# Questions:
- Why do the Choi methods work so badly? Are we using them wrong?
- For RAxML, we've been using the default argument "-T 2" which sets the number of threads to 2. But isn't this only for the multithreaded version `raxmlHPCÂ­PTHREADS`? If it isn't, then why are we only using 2 threads?

# Notes:

To install, cd inside the `spectral-tree-inference` folder and run 
```
pip install -e .
```
Now if you want to import the spectraltree package, for example for an experiment, you can simply run
```
import spectraltree
```
without modifying your path or doing anything ugly. You should only have to run `pip install -e .` one time. If you move the location of `spectraltree` folder, then run `pip uninstall spectraltree` and install again.

Note that if you are working inside the `spectraltree` directory itself, for example, modifying one of the reconstruction methods, and you need to access code from another file inside `spectraltree`, use a relative import:
```
from . import utils
from .utils import TaxaMetadata
```

To run the test suite, cd to `spectral-tree-inference` and run
```
python -m unittest discover
```
To run a specific module:
```
python -m unittest tests.test_similarity
```
Some of the third party methods (Forrest and RG) are pretty unreliable and so those tests may not pass. Just make sure they PASS or FAIL instead of throwing an ERROR.

# spectral-tree-inference
=======
Code for constructing phylogenetic trees from DNA sequence data. The file `reconstruct_tree.py` provides an alternative to the popular Neighbor Joining method of Saitou and Nei. This new method uses a criterion based on the second singular value of a specially constructed matrix that measures similarity between each pair of leaves in the tree. Several functions in that file construct such a matrix from a list of DNA sequences from a set of species. In general, the function `paralinear_distance` should be used for DNA data unless some stronger assumptions can be made. The function `estimate_tree_topology(distance_matrix)` takes such a matrix as input and outputs a tree describing the relationships between these species.

 The file `experiments.py` provides functions for comparing reconstruction methods on simulation data generated according to some evolutionary model. The file `generation.py` provides fast implementations of some such models built on the Dendropy library.

This repo is in the process of being refactored! Check back soon for updates and a link to our paper.

Joint work with Ariel Jaffe and Boaz Nadler.

### Dependencies
numpy
pandas
dendropy
seaborn


### Building an ultrametric tree (molecular clock)

```
balanced_binary(num_taxa, namespace=None, edge_length=1.)
lopsided_tree(num_taxa, namespace=None, edge_length=1.)
```

Start with a bunch of leaves. At each step draw `t` from an exponential
distribution with mean 1./(remaining nodes choose 2), extend all the branch lengths by `t`, and merge two of them that are chosen at random. In `mean_kingman` the branch length is exactly the mean of the distribution (which gets smaller as you move up the tree).
```
pure_kingman_tree(taxon_namespace=taxa)
mean_kingman_tree(taxon_namespace=taxa)
```

Birth death.
```
t = birth_death_tree(birth_rate=1., death_rate=0., num_total_tips=len(taxa), taxon_namespace=taxa)
t.collapse_basal_bifurcation()
```

### Building a non-ultrametric tree


```
t = birth_death_tree(birth_rate=1., death_rate=2., is_retain_extinct_tips=True, num_total_tips=len(taxa), taxon_namespace=taxa)
t.collapse_basal_bifurcation()
```

tree.minmax_leaf_distance_from_root()


### Generating sequence data
```
tree = balanced_binary(2**5, edge_length=0.1)
jc = Jukes_Cantor()
observations = jc.generate_sequences(tree, seq_len=10_000)
```

### Using seqgen
This is actually slower than the simulation code I made, even when you batch them.

## reconstructing a tree
```
distance_matrix = paralinear_distance(observations)
recovered_tree = estimate_tree_topology(distance_matrix, namespace=tree.taxon_namespace)
print(recovered_tree.as_ascii_plot())
dendropy.calculate.treecompare.false_positives_and_negatives(recovered_tree, tree, is_bipartitions_updated=False)
```


## Basic Dendropy functionality
```
```

```
s1 = "(A,(B,C));"
tree1 = dendropy.Tree.get(
        data=s1,
        schema="newick")
```

Printing
```
tree1.print_plot(width=80, plot_metric="length")
```

```
tree1.as_ascii_plot()
tree1.as_string("newick")
tree1.as_python_source()
```

Checking if a clan is in a tree
```
taxon_namespace.taxa_bipartition()
```
