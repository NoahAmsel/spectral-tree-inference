Latent Tree Toolbox (LTT)
Version 1.1, 7-Sep-2009

This toolbox contains code and examples used in the paper:

  "Greedy Learning of Binary Latent Trees"
  written by Stefan Harmeling and Christopher K.I. Williams


QUICKSTART: run "startup.m" and then "ltt_demo1.m", "ltt_demo2.m"...
SEE ALSO:   Contents.m

Most datasets are included in directory "data".  The remaining ones
can be automatically downloaded by running "data/get_others.sh".

PS: 
The word "forest" is commonly spelled with a single letter "r".
However, the double r'ed forrest as in 'ind_forrest.m', etc refers to
5 Forrest Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland, where the Institute for
Adaptive and Neural Computation (IANC) of the University of Edinburgh
School of Informatics has been located until 2008.
